# Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years.
# The program should first ask for the number of years. The outer loops will iterate once for each year. The inner loop
# will iterate twelve times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches
# of rainfall, and the average rainfall permonth for the entire period.
